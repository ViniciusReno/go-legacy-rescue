# Golang Legacy Rescue: From Over-Engineered to Maintainable

This repository presents a simplified but realistic case of a Golang microservice that became unmaintainable due to excessive abstraction and misuse of design patterns.

It includes:
- `v1_java_style/`: an overengineered version using Java-like SOLID patterns.
- `v2_refactored/`: a cleaned-up, idiomatic, and testable version.
- `rescue-notes.md`: commentary on decisions and trade-offs.
